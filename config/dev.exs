# For development, we disable any cache and enable
# debugging and code reloading.
#
# The watchers configuration can be used to run external
# watchers to your application. For example, we use it
# with webpack to recompile .js and .css sources.
# config :contract_observer, ContractObserverWeb.Endpoint,
#   http: [port: 4000],
#   debug_errors: true,
#   code_reloader: true,
#   check_origin: false,
#   watchers: []

# ## SSL Support
#
# In order to use HTTPS in development, a self-signed
# certificate can be generated by running the following
# Mix task:
#
#     mix phx.gen.cert
#
# Note that this task requires Erlang/OTP 20 or later.
# Run `mix help phx.gen.cert` for more information.
#
# The `http:` config above can be replaced with:
#
#     https: [
#       port: 4001,
#       cipher_suite: :strong,
#       keyfile: "priv/cert/selfsigned_key.pem",
#       certfile: "priv/cert/selfsigned.pem"
#     ],
#
# If desired, both `http:` and `https:` keys can be
# configured to run both http and https servers on
# different ports.

# Do not include metadata nor timestamps in development logs
config :logger, :console, format: "[$level] $message\n"

# Set a higher stacktrace during development. Avoid configuring such
# in production as building large stacktraces may be expensive.

# Initialize plugs at runtime for faster development compilation
